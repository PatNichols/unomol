# unomol
C++ quantum chemistry program for RHF UHF and positron scattering potentials

type make to build

Files that are appended with .DAT are binary while those appended with .out or .in
are text files.

To do:
1) DIIS scf acceleration
2) ROHF
3) Many body methods such a MP2 or Coupled Cluster?

The main goal of this project is _not_ to develop a quantum chemistry for
molecules but to develop a project for outputting static and polarization potentials
to be used in scattering calculations. If you need the former I would
suggest NWChem.
